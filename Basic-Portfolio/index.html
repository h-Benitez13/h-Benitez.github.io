                <p>
                    Born in Los Angeles, California. Home of the Dodgers, Lakers, tacos, and sunshine.
                    Despite being born in LA, growing up I moved alot do to my fathers work and other things...
                    By the time I hit 8th grade, I attended 13 to 14 different schools. 
                    Each school within a different city and state. Despite these changes I consider myself a true LA kid.
                </p>

                   I have 3 younger siblings who I consider my children. By the time I was 10, my parents were gone and I was left with three younger siblings at my grandparents house. 
                </p>
           
            <br>
                <p>
                    Practically raising them until I had to focus on my personal achievements, my siblings were (at times) still my everything.
                    Side tracking from family; I went to school in Syracuse, NY. Graduated with a B.A. in Psychology, focusing on Interpersonal Relationships.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, I live in Center City, working in King Of Prussia! Forty minute commute, which isnt bad since I listen to music at a level that is considered "ear bursting".
                    And that's pretty much it, I guess. In defining terms of personality I like pizza, music, movies and basketball.
